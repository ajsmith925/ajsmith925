## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm Alex Smith, I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** (specializing in **Javascript/Typescript Applications**) and an advocate of leveraging **Cloud Technologies**

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have contributed to a couple large Organizations. I am really enthusiastic about constantly learning new technology.

🦾 Also interested in Crypto, DApps, AI, and ML.

🌱 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **being outdoors and backpacking**, **fitness & sports (climbing, basketball,snowboarding, etc)**, **traveling**, and **trying new things** but **doing anything or nothing with my wife** trumps them all! 

🧘‍♂️ I also love meditating, reading books, & personal development. One percent better every day compounds greatly!
